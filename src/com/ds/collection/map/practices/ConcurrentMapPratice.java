	/**
	 * 
	 * The `ConcurrentMap` is an interface which is part of the Java Collection
	 * Framework and is available in the `java.until.concurrent` package.
	 * 
	 * It extends the `Map` interface and provides thread-safe operations during
	 * retrieval, updation, and removal of elements.
	 * 
	 * The benefit of using `ConcurrentMap` is that it allows high concurrency for
	 * retrieval and updates without affecting the performance.
	 * 
	 * Common implementations of `ConcurrentMap` are `ConcurrentHashMap`,
	 * `ConcurrentSkipListMap`, etc.
	 * 
	 * One of the main features of `ConcurrentMap` is its atomic operations like 
	 * `putIfAbsent()`, `remove()`, and `replace()` which were added to improve 
	 * concurrent handling while ensuring integrity of the data.
	 * 
	 * Here's a brief explanation of these atomic methods:
	 * 
	 * 1. `putIfAbsent(key, value)`: This method adds a key-value pair to the map
	 *    only if the key is not already associated with any value.
	 *    
	 * 2. `remove(key, value)`: This method removes the entry for a key only if it
	 *    is currently mapped to the specified value.
	 *    
	 * 3. `replace(key, oldValue, newValue)`: This method replaces the entry for a
	 *    key only if currently mapped to the specified value.
	 *    
	 * Let me give you an example of using `ConcurrentHashMap`, one of the 
	 * implementations of `ConcurrentMap`.       
	 *
